<H1 CLASS="chapter"><A NAME="htoc111">Chapter&#XA0;12</A>&#XA0;&#XA0; Local FITS Conventions </H1><P>CFITSIO supports several local FITS conventions which are not
defined in the official NOST FITS standard and which are not
necessarily recognized or supported by other FITS software packages.
Programmers should be cautious about using these features, especially
if the FITS files that are produced are expected to be processed by
other software systems which do not use the CFITSIO interface.</P><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc63"></A><A NAME="htoc112">12.1</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;64-Bit Long Integers</H2><P>CFITSIO supports reading and writing FITS images or table columns containing
64-bit integer data values. Support for 64-bit integers was added to the
official FITS Standard in December 2005.
FITS 64-bit images have BITPIX =
64, and the 64-bit binary table columns have TFORMn = &#X2019;K&#X2019;. CFITSIO also
supports the &#X2019;Q&#X2019; variable-length array table column format which is
analogous to the &#X2019;P&#X2019; column format except that the array descriptor
is stored as a pair of 64-bit integers.</P><P>For the convenience of C programmers, the fitsio.h include file
defines (with a typedef statement) the &#X2019;LONGLONG&#X2019; datatype to be
equivalent to an appropriate 64-bit integer datatype on each platform.
Since there is currently no universal standard
for the name of the 64-bit integer datatype (it might be defined as
&#X2019;long long&#X2019;, &#X2019;long&#X2019;, or &#X2019;__int64&#X2019; depending on the platform)
C programmers may prefer to use the &#X2019;LONGLONG&#X2019; datatype when
declaring or allocating 64-bit integer quantities when writing
code which needs to run on multiple platforms.
Note that CFITSIO will implicitly convert the datatype when reading
or writing FITS 64-bit integer images and columns with data arrays of
a different integer or floating point datatype, but there is an
increased risk of loss of numerical precision or
numerical overflow in this case.</P><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc64"></A><A NAME="htoc113">12.2</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Long String Keyword Values.</H2><P>The length of a standard FITS string keyword is limited to 68
characters because it must fit entirely within a single FITS header
keyword record. In some instances it is necessary to encode strings
longer than this limit, so CFITSIO supports a local convention in which
the string value is continued over multiple keywords. This
continuation convention uses an ampersand character at the end of each
substring to indicate that it is continued on the next keyword, and the
continuation keywords all have the name CONTINUE without an equal sign
in column 9. The string value may be continued in this way over as many
additional CONTINUE keywords as is required. The following lines
illustrate this continuation convention which is used in the value of
the STRKEY keyword:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">LONGSTRN= 'OGIP 1.0'    / The OGIP Long String Convention may be used.
STRKEY  = 'This is a very long string keyword&amp;'  / Optional Comment
CONTINUE  ' value that is continued over 3 keywords in the &amp;  '
CONTINUE  'FITS header.' / This is another optional comment.
</PRE><P>It is recommended that the LONGSTRN keyword, as shown here, always be
included in any HDU that uses this longstring convention as a warning
to any software that must read the keywords. A routine called fits_write_key_longwarn
has been provided in CFITSIO to write this keyword if it does not
already exist.</P><P>This long string convention is supported by the following CFITSIO
routines:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">    fits_write_key_longstr  - write a long string keyword value
    fits_insert_key_longstr - insert a long string keyword value
    fits_modify_key_longstr - modify a long string keyword value
    fits_update_key_longstr - modify a long string keyword value
    fits_read_key_longstr   - read  a long string keyword value
    fits_delete_key         - delete a keyword
</PRE><P>The fits_read_key_longstr routine is unique among all the CFITSIO
routines in that it internally allocates memory for the long string
value; all the other CFITSIO routines that deal with arrays require
that the calling program pre-allocate adequate space to hold the array
of data. Consequently, programs which use the fits_read_key_longstr
routine must be careful to free the allocated memory for the string
when it is no longer needed.</P><P>The following 2 routines also have limited support for this long string
convention,</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">      fits_modify_key_str - modify an existing string keyword value
      fits_update_key_str - update a string keyword value
</PRE><P>in that they will correctly overwrite an existing long string value,
but the new string value is limited to a maximum of 68 characters in
length.</P><P>The more commonly used CFITSIO routines to write string valued keywords
(fits_update_key and fits_write_key) do not support this long
string convention and only support strings up to 68 characters in
length. This has been done deliberately to prevent programs from
inadvertently writing keywords using this non-standard convention
without the explicit intent of the programmer or user. The
fits_write_key_longstr routine must be called instead to write long
strings. This routine can also be used to write ordinary string values
less than 68 characters in length.</P><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc65"></A><A NAME="htoc114">12.3</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Arrays of Fixed-Length Strings in Binary Tables</H2><P>CFITSIO supports 2 ways to specify that a character column in a binary
table contains an array of fixed-length strings. The first way, which
is officially supported by the FITS Standard document, uses the TDIMn keyword.
For example, if TFORMn = &#X2019;60A&#X2019; and TDIMn = &#X2019;(12,5)&#X2019; then that
column will be interpreted as containing an array of 5 strings, each 12
characters long.</P><P>CFITSIO also supports a
local convention for the format of the TFORMn keyword value of the form
&#X2019;rAw&#X2019; where &#X2019;r&#X2019; is an integer specifying the total width in characters
of the column, and &#X2019;w&#X2019; is an integer specifying the (fixed) length of
an individual unit string within the vector. For example, TFORM1 =
&#X2019;120A10&#X2019; would indicate that the binary table column is 120 characters
wide and consists of 12 10-character length strings. This convention
is recognized by the CFITSIO routines that read or write strings in
binary tables. The Binary Table definition document specifies that
other optional characters may follow the data type code in the TFORM
keyword, so this local convention is in compliance with the
FITS standard although other FITS readers may not
recognize this convention.</P><P>The Binary Table definition document that was approved by the IAU in
1994 contains an appendix describing an alternate convention for
specifying arrays of fixed or variable length strings in a binary table
character column (with the form &#X2019;rA:SSTRw/nnn)&#X2019;. This appendix was not
officially voted on by the IAU and hence is still provisional. CFITSIO
does not currently support this proposal.</P><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc66"></A><A NAME="htoc115">12.4</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Keyword Units Strings</H2><P>One limitation of the current FITS Standard is that it does not define
a specific convention for recording the physical units of a keyword
value. The TUNITn keyword can be used to specify the physical units of
the values in a table column, but there is no analogous convention for
keyword values. The comment field of the keyword is often used for
this purpose, but the units are usually not specified in a well defined
format that FITS readers can easily recognize and extract.</P><P>To solve this problem, CFITSIO uses a local convention in which the
keyword units are enclosed in square brackets as the first token in the
keyword comment field; more specifically, the opening square bracket
immediately follows the slash &#X2019;/&#X2019; comment field delimiter and a single
space character. The following examples illustrate keywords that use
this convention:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">EXPOSURE=               1800.0 / [s] elapsed exposure time
V_HELIO =                16.23 / [km s**(-1)] heliocentric velocity
LAMBDA  =                5400. / [angstrom] central wavelength
FLUX    = 4.9033487787637465E-30 / [J/cm**2/s] average flux
</PRE><P>In general, the units named in the IAU(1988) Style Guide are
recommended, with the main exception that the preferred unit for angle
is &#X2019;deg&#X2019; for degrees.</P><P>The fits_read_key_unit and fits_write_key_unit routines in
CFITSIO read and write, respectively, the keyword unit strings in an
existing keyword.</P><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc67"></A><A NAME="htoc116">12.5</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;HIERARCH Convention for Extended Keyword Names</H2><P>CFITSIO supports the HIERARCH keyword convention which allows keyword
names that are longer then 8 characters and may contain the full range
of printable ASCII text characters. This convention
was developed at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) to support
hierarchical FITS keyword such as:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">HIERARCH ESO INS FOCU POS = -0.00002500 / Focus position
</PRE><P>Basically, this convention uses the FITS keyword &#X2019;HIERARCH&#X2019; to indicate
that this convention is being used, then the actual keyword name
(<TT>&#X2019;ESO INS FOCU POS&#X2019;</TT> in this example) begins in column 10 and can
contain any printable ASCII text characters, including spaces. The
equals sign marks the end of the keyword name and is followed by the
usual value and comment fields just as in standard FITS keywords.
Further details of this convention are described at
http://arcdev.hq.eso.org/dicb/dicd/dic-1-1.4.html (search for
HIERARCH).</P><P>This convention allows a much broader range of keyword names
than is allowed by the FITS Standard. Here are more examples
of such keywords:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">HIERARCH LongKeyword = 47.5 / Keyword has &gt; 8 characters, and mixed case
HIERARCH XTE$TEMP = 98.6 / Keyword contains the '$' character
HIERARCH Earth is a star = F / Keyword contains embedded spaces
</PRE><P>CFITSIO will transparently read and write these keywords, so application
programs do not in general need to know anything about the specific
implementation details of the HIERARCH convention. In particular,
application programs do not need to specify the &#X2018;HIERARCH&#X2019; part of the
keyword name when reading or writing keywords (although it
may be included if desired). When writing a keyword, CFITSIO first
checks to see if the keyword name is legal as a standard FITS keyword
(no more than 8 characters long and containing only letters, digits, or
a minus sign or underscore). If so it writes it as a standard FITS
keyword, otherwise it uses the hierarch convention to write the
keyword. The maximum keyword name length is 67 characters, which
leaves only 1 space for the value field. A more practical limit is
about 40 characters, which leaves enough room for most keyword values.
CFITSIO returns an error if there is not enough room for both the
keyword name and the keyword value on the 80-character card, except for
string-valued keywords which are simply truncated so that the closing
quote character falls in column 80. In the current implementation,
CFITSIO preserves the case of the letters when writing the keyword
name, but it is case-insensitive when reading or searching for a
keyword. The current implementation allows any ASCII text character
(ASCII 32 to ASCII 126) in the keyword name except for the &#X2019;=&#X2019;
character. A space is also required on either side of the equal sign.</P><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc68"></A><A NAME="htoc117">12.6</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Tile-Compressed Image Format</H2><P>CFITSIO supports a convention for compressing n-dimensional images and
storing the resulting byte stream in a variable-length column in a FITS
binary table. The general principle used in this convention is to
first divide the n-dimensional image into a rectangular grid of
subimages or &#X2018;tiles&#X2019;. Each tile is then compressed as a continuous
block of data, and the resulting compressed byte stream is stored in a
row of a variable length column in a FITS binary table. By dividing the
image into tiles it is generally possible to extract and uncompress
subsections of the image without having to uncompress the whole image.
The default tiling pattern treats each row of a 2-dimensional image (or
higher dimensional cube) as a tile, such that each tile contains NAXIS1
pixels (except the default with the HCOMPRESS algorithm is to
compress the whole 2D image as a single tile). Any other rectangular
tiling pattern may also be defined. In
the case of relatively small images it may be sufficient to compress
the entire image as a single tile, resulting in an output binary table
with 1 row. In the case of 3-dimensional data cubes, it may be
advantageous to treat each plane of the cube as a separate tile if
application software typically needs to access the cube on a plane by
plane basis.</P><P>See section 5.6 &#X201C;Image Compression&#X201D;
for more information on using this tile-compressed image format.</P><HR>
