<H1 CLASS="chapter"><A NAME="htoc118">Chapter&#XA0;13</A>&#XA0;&#XA0; Optimizing Programs </H1><P>CFITSIO has been carefully designed to obtain the highest possible
speed when reading and writing FITS files. In order to achieve the
best performance, however, application programmers must be careful to
call the CFITSIO routines appropriately and in an efficient sequence;
inappropriate usage of CFITSIO routines can greatly slow down the
execution speed of a program.</P><P>The maximum possible I/O speed of CFITSIO depends of course on the type
of computer system that it is running on. As a rough guide, the
current generation of workstations can achieve speeds of 2 &#X2013; 10 MB/s
when reading or writing FITS images and similar, or slightly slower
speeds with FITS binary tables. Reading of FITS files can occur at
even higher rates (30MB/s or more) if the FITS file is still cached in
system memory following a previous read or write operation on the same
file. To more accurately predict the best performance that is possible
on any particular system, a diagnostic program called &#X201C;speed.c&#X201D; is
included with the CFITSIO distribution which can be run to
approximately measure the maximum possible speed of writing and reading
a test FITS file.</P><P>The following 2 sections provide some background on how CFITSIO
internally manages the data I/O and describes some strategies that may
be used to optimize the processing speed of software that uses
CFITSIO.</P><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc69"></A><A NAME="htoc119">13.1</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;How CFITSIO Manages Data I/O</H2><P>Many CFITSIO operations involve transferring only a small number of
bytes to or from the FITS file (e.g, reading a keyword, or writing a
row in a table); it would be very inefficient to physically read or
write such small blocks of data directly in the FITS file on disk,
therefore CFITSIO maintains a set of internal Input&#X2013;Output (IO)
buffers in RAM memory that each contain one FITS block (2880 bytes) of
data. Whenever CFITSIO needs to access data in the FITS file, it first
transfers the FITS block containing those bytes into one of the IO
buffers in memory. The next time CFITSIO needs to access bytes in the
same block it can then go to the fast IO buffer rather than using a
much slower system disk access routine. The number of available IO
buffers is determined by the NIOBUF parameter (in fitsio2.h) and is
currently set to 40 by default.</P><P>Whenever CFITSIO reads or writes data it first checks to see if that
block of the FITS file is already loaded into one of the IO buffers.
If not, and if there is an empty IO buffer available, then it will load
that block into the IO buffer (when reading a FITS file) or will
initialize a new block (when writing to a FITS file). If all the IO
buffers are already full, it must decide which one to reuse (generally
the one that has been accessed least recently), and flush the contents
back to disk if it has been modified before loading the new block.</P><P>The one major exception to the above process occurs whenever a large
contiguous set of bytes are accessed, as might occur when reading or
writing a FITS image. In this case CFITSIO bypasses the internal IO
buffers and simply reads or writes the desired bytes directly in the
disk file with a single call to a low-level file read or write
routine. The minimum threshold for the number of bytes to read or
write this way is set by the MINDIRECT parameter and is currently set
to 3 FITS blocks = 8640 bytes. This is the most efficient way to read
or write large chunks of data and can achieve IO transfer rates of
5 &#X2013; 10MB/s or greater. Note that this fast direct IO process is not
applicable when accessing columns of data in a FITS table because the
bytes are generally not contiguous since they are interleaved by the
other columns of data in the table. This explains why the speed for
accessing FITS tables is generally slower than accessing
FITS images.</P><P>Given this background information, the general strategy for efficiently
accessing FITS files should be apparent: when dealing with FITS
images, read or write large chunks of data at a time so that the direct
IO mechanism will be invoked; when accessing FITS headers or FITS
tables, on the other hand, once a particular FITS block has been
loading into one of the IO buffers, try to access all the needed
information in that block before it gets flushed out of the IO buffer.
It is important to avoid the situation where the same FITS block is
being read then flushed from a IO buffer multiple times.</P><P>The following section gives more specific suggestions for optimizing
the use of CFITSIO.</P><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc70"></A><A NAME="htoc120">13.2</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Optimization Strategies</H2><P>1. When dealing with a FITS primary array or IMAGE extension, it is
more efficient to read or write large chunks of the image at a time
(at least 3 FITS blocks = 8640 bytes) so that the direct IO mechanism
will be used as described in the previous section. Smaller chunks of
data are read or written via the IO buffers, which is somewhat less
efficient because of the extra copy operation and additional
bookkeeping steps that are required. In principle it is more efficient
to read or write as big an array of image pixels at one time as
possible, however, if the array becomes so large that the operating
system cannot store it all in RAM, then the performance may be degraded
because of the increased swapping of virtual memory to disk.</P><P>2. When dealing with FITS tables, the most important efficiency factor
in the software design is to read or write the data in the FITS file in
a single pass through the file. An example of poor program design
would be to read a large, 3-column table by sequentially reading the
entire first column, then going back to read the 2nd column, and
finally the 3rd column; this obviously requires 3 passes through the
file which could triple the execution time of an IO limited program.
For small tables this is not important, but when reading multi-megabyte
sized tables these inefficiencies can become significant. The more
efficient procedure in this case is to read or write only as many rows
of the table as will fit into the available internal IO buffers, then
access all the necessary columns of data within that range of rows.
Then after the program is completely finished with the data in those
rows it can move on to the next range of rows that will fit in the
buffers, continuing in this way until the entire file has been
processed. By using this procedure of accessing all the columns of a
table in parallel rather than sequentially, each block of the FITS file
will only be read or written once.</P><P>The optimal number of rows to read or write at one time in a given
table depends on the width of the table row and on the number of IO
buffers that have been allocated in CFITSIO. The CFITSIO Iterator routine
will automatically use the optimal-sized buffer, but there is also a
CFITSIO routine that will return the optimal number of rows for a given
table: fits_get_rowsize. It is not critical to use exactly the
value of nrows returned by this routine, as long as one does not exceed
it. Using a very small value however can also lead to poor performance
because of the overhead from the larger number of subroutine calls.</P><P>The optimal number of rows returned by fits_get_rowsize is valid only
as long as the application program is only reading or writing data in
the specified table. Any other calls to access data in the table
header would cause additional blocks of data
to be loaded into the IO buffers displacing data from the original
table, and should be avoided during the critical period while the table
is being read or written.</P><P>3. Use the CFITSIO Iterator routine. This routine provides a
more &#X2018;object oriented&#X2019; way of reading and writing FITS files
which automatically uses the most appropriate data buffer size
to achieve the maximum I/O throughput.</P><P>4. Use binary table extensions rather than ASCII table
extensions for better efficiency when dealing with tabular data. The
I/O to ASCII tables is slower because of the overhead in formatting or
parsing the ASCII data fields and because ASCII tables are about twice
as large as binary tables with the same information content.</P><P>5. Design software so that it reads the FITS header keywords in the
same order in which they occur in the file. When reading keywords,
CFITSIO searches forward starting from the position of the last keyword
that was read. If it reaches the end of the header without finding the
keyword, it then goes back to the start of the header and continues the
search down to the position where it started. In practice, as long as
the entire FITS header can fit at one time in the available internal IO
buffers, then the header keyword access will be very fast and it makes
little difference which order they are accessed.</P><P>6. Avoid the use of scaling (by using the BSCALE and BZERO or TSCAL and
TZERO keywords) in FITS files since the scaling operations add to the
processing time needed to read or write the data. In some cases it may
be more efficient to temporarily turn off the scaling (using fits_set_bscale or
fits_set_tscale) and then read or write the raw unscaled values in the FITS
file.</P><P>7. Avoid using the &#X2018;implicit data type conversion&#X2019; capability in
CFITSIO. For instance, when reading a FITS image with BITPIX = -32
(32-bit floating point pixels), read the data into a single precision
floating point data array in the program. Forcing CFITSIO to convert
the data to a different data type can slow the program.</P><P>8. Where feasible, design FITS binary tables using vector column
elements so that the data are written as a contiguous set of bytes,
rather than as single elements in multiple rows. For example, it is
faster to access the data in a table that contains a single row
and 2 columns with TFORM keywords equal to &#X2019;10000E&#X2019; and &#X2019;10000J&#X2019;, than
it is to access the same amount of data in a table with 10000 rows
which has columns with the TFORM keywords equal to &#X2019;1E&#X2019; and &#X2019;1J&#X2019;. In
the former case the 10000 floating point values in the first column are
all written in a contiguous block of the file which can be read or
written quickly, whereas in the second case each floating point value
in the first column is interleaved with the integer value in the second
column of the same row so CFITSIO has to explicitly move to the
position of each element to be read or written.</P><P>9. Avoid the use of variable length vector columns in binary tables,
since any reading or writing of these data requires that CFITSIO first
look up or compute the starting address of each row of data in the
heap. In practice, this is probably not a significant efficiency issue.</P><P>10. When copying data from one FITS table to another, it is faster to
transfer the raw bytes instead of reading then writing each column of
the table. The CFITSIO routines fits_read_tblbytes and
fits_write_tblbytes will perform low-level reads or writes of any
contiguous range of bytes in a table extension. These routines can be
used to read or write a whole row (or multiple rows for even greater
efficiency) of a table with a single function call. These routines
are fast because they bypass all the usual data scaling, error checking
and machine dependent data conversion that is normally done by CFITSIO,
and they allow the program to write the data to the output file in
exactly the same byte order. For these same reasons, these routines
can corrupt the FITS data file if used incorrectly because no
validation or machine dependent conversion is performed by these
routines. These routines are only recommended for optimizing critical
pieces of code and should only be used by programmers who thoroughly
understand the internal format of the FITS tables they are reading or
writing.</P><P>11. Another strategy for improving the speed of writing a FITS table,
similar to the previous one, is to directly construct the entire byte
stream for a whole table row (or multiple rows) within the application
program and then write it to the FITS file with
fits_write_tblbytes. This avoids all the overhead normally present
in the column-oriented CFITSIO write routines. This technique should
only be used for critical applications because it makes the code more
difficult to understand and maintain, and it makes the code more system
dependent (e.g., do the bytes need to be swapped before writing to the
FITS file?).</P><P>12. Finally, external factors such as the speed of the magnetic disk,
the size of the disk cache, the amount of disk fragmentation, and the amount of
RAM available on the system can all have a significant impact on
overall I/O efficiency. For critical applications, the entire hardware
and software system should be reviewed to identify any
potential I/O bottlenecks.</P><P>
