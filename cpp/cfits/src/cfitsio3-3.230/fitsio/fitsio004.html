<H1 CLASS="chapter"><A NAME="htoc10">Chapter&#XA0;3</A>&#XA0;&#XA0; A FITS Primer </H1><P>This section gives a brief overview of the structure of FITS files.
Users should refer to the documentation available from the NOST, as
described in the introduction, for more detailed information on FITS
formats.</P><P>FITS was first developed in the late 1970&#X2019;s as a standard data
interchange format between various astronomical observatories. Since
then FITS has become the defacto standard data format supported by most
astronomical data analysis software packages.</P><P>A FITS file consists of one or more Header + Data Units (HDUs), where
the first HDU is called the &#X2018;Primary HDU&#X2019;, or &#X2018;Primary Array&#X2019;. The
primary array contains an N-dimensional array of pixels, such as a 1-D
spectrum, a 2-D image, or a 3-D data cube. Six different primary
datatypes are supported: Unsigned 8-bit bytes, 16, 32, and 64-bit signed
integers, and 32 and 64-bit floating point reals. FITS also has a
convention for storing unsigned integers (see the later
section entitled &#X2018;Unsigned Integers&#X2019; for more details). The primary HDU
may also consist of only a header with a null array containing no
data pixels.</P><P>Any number of additional HDUs may follow the primary array; these
additional HDUs are called FITS &#X2018;extensions&#X2019;. There are currently 3
types of extensions defined by the FITS standard:</P><UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
Image Extension - a N-dimensional array of pixels, like in a primary array
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">ASCII Table Extension - rows and columns of data in ASCII character format
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">Binary Table Extension - rows and columns of data in binary representation
</LI></UL><P>In each case the HDU consists of an ASCII Header Unit followed by an optional
Data Unit. For historical reasons, each Header or Data unit must be an
exact multiple of 2880 8-bit bytes long. Any unused space is padded
with fill characters (ASCII blanks or zeros).</P><P>Each Header Unit consists of any number of 80-character keyword records
or &#X2018;card images&#X2019; which have the general form:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">  KEYNAME = value / comment string
  NULLKEY =       / comment: This keyword has no value
</PRE><P>The keyword names may be up to 8 characters long and can only contain
uppercase letters, the digits 0-9, the hyphen, and the underscore
character. The keyword name is (usually) followed by an equals sign and
a space character (= ) in columns 9 - 10 of the record, followed by the
value of the keyword which may be either an integer, a floating point
number, a character string (enclosed in single quotes), or a boolean
value (the letter T or F). A keyword may also have a null or undefined
value if there is no specified value string, as in the second example.</P><P>The last keyword in the header is always the &#X2018;END&#X2019; keyword which has no
value or comment fields. There are many rules governing the exact
format of a keyword record (see the NOST FITS Standard) so it is better
to rely on standard interface software like FITSIO to correctly
construct or to parse the keyword records rather than try to deal
directly with the raw FITS formats.</P><P>Each Header Unit begins with a series of required keywords which depend
on the type of HDU. These required keywords specify the size and
format of the following Data Unit. The header may contain other
optional keywords to describe other aspects of the data, such as the
units or scaling values. Other COMMENT or HISTORY keywords are also
frequently added to further document the data file.</P><P>The optional Data Unit immediately follows the last 2880-byte block in
the Header Unit. Some HDUs do not have a Data Unit and only consist of
the Header Unit.</P><P>If there is more than one HDU in the FITS file, then the Header Unit of
the next HDU immediately follows the last 2880-byte block of the
previous Data Unit (or Header Unit if there is no Data Unit).</P><P>The main required keywords in FITS primary arrays or image extensions are:
</P><UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
BITPIX &#X2013; defines the datatype of the array: 8, 16, 32, 64, -32, -64 for
unsigned 8&#X2013;bit byte, 16&#X2013;bit signed integer, 32&#X2013;bit signed integer,
64&#X2013;bit signed integer,
32&#X2013;bit IEEE floating point, and 64&#X2013;bit IEEE double precision floating
point, respectively.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">NAXIS &#X2013; the number of dimensions in the array, usually 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">NAXISn &#X2013; (n ranges from 1 to NAXIS) defines the size of each dimension.
</LI></UL><P>FITS tables start with the keyword XTENSION = &#X2018;TABLE&#X2019; (for ASCII
tables) or XTENSION = &#X2018;BINTABLE&#X2019; (for binary tables) and have the
following main keywords:
</P><UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
TFIELDS &#X2013; number of fields or columns in the table
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">NAXIS2 &#X2013; number of rows in the table
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">TTYPEn &#X2013; for each column (n ranges from 1 to TFIELDS) gives the
name of the column
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">TFORMn &#X2013; the datatype of the column
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">TUNITn &#X2013; the physical units of the column (optional)
</LI></UL><P>Users should refer to the FITS Support Office at <TT>http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov</TT>

packages.
