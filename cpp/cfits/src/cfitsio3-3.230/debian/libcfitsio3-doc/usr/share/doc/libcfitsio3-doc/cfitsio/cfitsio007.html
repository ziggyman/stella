<H1 CLASS="chapter"><A NAME="htoc52">Chapter&#XA0;6</A>&#XA0;&#XA0; The CFITSIO Iterator Function </H1><P>The fits_iterate_data function in CFITSIO provides a unique method of
executing an arbitrary user-supplied &#X2018;work&#X2019; function that operates on
rows of data in FITS tables or on pixels in FITS images. Rather than
explicitly reading and writing the FITS images or columns of data, one
instead calls the CFITSIO iterator routine, passing to it the name of
the user&#X2019;s work function that is to be executed along with a list of
all the table columns or image arrays that are to be passed to the work
function. The CFITSIO iterator function then does all the work of
allocating memory for the arrays, reading the input data from the FITS
file, passing them to the work function, and then writing any output
data back to the FITS file after the work function exits. Because
it is often more efficient to process only a subset of the total table
rows at one time, the iterator function can determine the optimum
amount of data to pass in each iteration and repeatedly call the work
function until the entire table been processed.</P><P>For many applications this single CFITSIO iterator function can
effectively replace all the other CFITSIO routines for reading or
writing data in FITS images or tables. Using the iterator has several
important advantages over the traditional method of reading and writing
FITS data files:</P><UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
It cleanly separates the data I/O from the routine that operates on
the data. This leads to a more modular and &#X2018;object oriented&#X2019;
programming style.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">It simplifies the application program by eliminating the need to allocate
memory for the data arrays and eliminates most of the calls to the CFITSIO
routines that explicitly read and write the data.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">It ensures that the data are processed as efficiently as possible.
This is especially important when processing tabular data since
the iterator function will calculate the most efficient number
of rows in the table to be passed at one time to the user&#X2019;s work
function on each iteration.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">Makes it possible for larger projects to develop a library of work
functions that all have a uniform calling sequence and are all
independent of the details of the FITS file format.</LI></UL><P>There are basically 2 steps in using the CFITSIO iterator function.
The first step is to design the work function itself which must have a
prescribed set of input parameters. One of these parameters is a
structure containing pointers to the arrays of data; the work function
can perform any desired operations on these arrays and does not need to
worry about how the input data were read from the file or how the
output data get written back to the file.</P><P>The second step is to design the driver routine that opens all the
necessary FITS files and initializes the input parameters to the
iterator function. The driver program calls the CFITSIO iterator
function which then reads the data and passes it to the user&#X2019;s work
function.</P><P>The following 2 sections describe these steps in more detail. There
are also several example programs included with the CFITSIO
distribution which illustrate how to use the iterator function.</P><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc32"></A><A NAME="htoc53">6.1</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;The Iterator Work Function</H2><P>The user-supplied iterator work function must have the following set of
input parameters (the function can be given any desired name):</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">  int user_fn( long totaln, long offset, long firstn, long nvalues,
               int narrays, iteratorCol *data,  void *userPointer )
</PRE><UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">totaln &#X2013; the total number of table rows or image pixels
that will be passed to the work function
during 1 or more iterations.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">offset &#X2013; the offset applied to the first table row or image
pixel to be passed to the work function. In other
words, this is the number of rows or pixels that
are skipped over before starting the iterations. If
offset = 0, then all the table rows or image pixels
will be passed to the work function.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">firstn &#X2013; the number of the first table row or image pixel
(starting with 1) that is being passed in this
particular call to the work function.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">nvalues &#X2013; the number of table rows or image pixels that are
being passed in this particular call to the work
function. nvalues will always be less than or
equal to totaln and will have the same value on
each iteration, except possibly on the last
call which may have a smaller value.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">narrays &#X2013; the number of arrays of data that are being passed
to the work function. There is one array for each
image or table column.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">*data &#X2013; array of structures, one for each
column or image. Each structure contains a pointer
to the array of data as well as other descriptive
parameters about that array.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">*userPointer &#X2013; a user supplied pointer that can be used
to pass ancillary information from the driver function
to the work function.
This pointer is passed to the CFITSIO iterator function
which then passes it on to the
work function without any modification.
It may point to a single number, to an array of values,
to a structure containing an arbitrary set of parameters
of different types,
or it may be a null pointer if it is not needed.
The work function must cast this pointer to the
appropriate data type before using it it.
</LI></UL><P>The totaln, offset, narrays, data, and userPointer parameters are
guaranteed to have the same value on each iteration. Only firstn,
nvalues, and the arrays of data pointed to by the data structures may
change on each iterative call to the work function.</P><P>Note that the iterator treats an image as a long 1-D array of pixels
regardless of it&#X2019;s intrinsic dimensionality. The total number of
pixels is just the product of the size of each dimension, and the order
of the pixels is the same as the order that they are stored in the FITS
file. If the work function needs to know the number and size of the
image dimensions then these parameters can be passed via the
userPointer structure.</P><P>The iteratorCol structure is currently defined as follows:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">typedef struct  /* structure for the iterator function column information */
{
   /* structure elements required as input to fits_iterate_data: */

  fitsfile *fptr;       /* pointer to the HDU containing the column or image */
  int      colnum;      /* column number in the table; ignored for images    */
  char     colname[70]; /* name (TTYPEn) of the column; null for images      */
  int      datatype;    /* output data type (converted if necessary) */
  int      iotype;      /* type: InputCol, InputOutputCol, or OutputCol */

  /* output structure elements that may be useful for the work function: */

  void     *array;    /* pointer to the array (and the null value) */
  long     repeat;    /* binary table vector repeat value; set     */
                      /*     equal to 1 for images                 */
  long     tlmin;     /* legal minimum data value, if any          */
  long     tlmax;     /* legal maximum data value, if any          */
  char     unit[70];  /* physical unit string (BUNIT or TUNITn)    */
  char     tdisp[70]; /* suggested display format; null if none    */

} iteratorCol;
</PRE><P>Instead of directly reading or writing the elements in this structure,
it is recommended that programmers use the access functions that are
provided for this purpose.</P><P>The first five elements in this structure must be initially defined by
the driver routine before calling the iterator routine. The CFITSIO
iterator routine uses this information to determine what column or
array to pass to the work function, and whether the array is to be
input to the work function, output from the work function, or both.
The CFITSIO iterator function fills in the values of the remaining
structure elements before passing it to the work function.</P><P>The array structure element is a pointer to the actual data array and
it must be cast to the correct data type before it is used. The
&#X2018;repeat&#X2019; structure element give the number of data values in each row
of the table, so that the total number of data values in the array is
given by repeat * nvalues. In the case of image arrays and ASCII
tables, repeat will always be equal to 1. When the data type is a
character string, the array pointer is actually a pointer to an array
of string pointers (i.e., char **array). The other output structure
elements are provided for convenience in case that information is
needed within the work function. Any other information may be passed
from the driver routine to the work function via the userPointer
parameter.</P><P>Upon completion, the work routine must return an integer status value,
with 0 indicating success and any other value indicating an error which
will cause the iterator function to immediately exit at that point. Return status
values in the range 1 &#X2013; 1000 should be avoided since these are
reserved for use by CFITSIO. A return status value of -1 may be used to
force the CFITSIO iterator function to stop at that point and return
control to the driver routine after writing any output arrays to the
FITS file. CFITSIO does not considered this to be an error condition,
so any further processing by the application program will continue normally.</P><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc33"></A><A NAME="htoc54">6.2</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;The Iterator Driver Function</H2><P>The iterator driver function must open the necessary FITS files and
position them to the correct HDU. It must also initialize the following
parameters in the iteratorCol structure (defined above) for each
column or image before calling the CFITSIO iterator function.
Several &#X2018;constructor&#X2019; routines are provided in CFITSIO for this
purpose.</P><UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
*fptr &#X2013; The fitsfile pointer to the table or image.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">colnum &#X2013; the number of the column in the table. This value is ignored
in the case of images. If colnum equals 0, then the column name
will be used to identify the column to be passed to the
work function.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">colname &#X2013; the name (TTYPEn keyword) of the column. This is
only required if colnum = 0 and is ignored for images.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">datatype &#X2013; The desired data type of the array to be passed to the
work function. For numerical data the data type does
not need to be the same as the actual data type in the
FITS file, in which case CFITSIO will do the conversion.
Allowed values are: TSTRING, TLOGICAL, TBYTE, TSBYTE, TSHORT, TUSHORT,
TINT, TLONG, TULONG, TFLOAT, TDOUBLE. If the input
value of data type equals 0, then the existing
data type of the column or image will be used without
any conversion.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">iotype &#X2013; defines whether the data array is to be input to the
work function (i.e, read from the FITS file), or output
from the work function (i.e., written to the FITS file) or
both. Allowed values are InputCol, OutputCol, or InputOutputCol.
	 Variable-length array columns are supported as InputCol or
	 InputOutputCol types, but may not be used for an OutputCol type.
</LI></UL><P>After the driver routine has initialized all these parameters, it
can then call the CFITSIO iterator function:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">  int fits_iterate_data(int narrays, iteratorCol *data, long offset,
      long nPerLoop, int (*workFn)( ), void *userPointer, int *status);
</PRE><UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
<P>narrays &#X2013; the number of columns or images that are to be passed
to the work function.
</P></LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">*data &#X2013; pointer to array of structures containing information
about each column or image.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">offset &#X2013; if positive, this number of rows at the
beginning of the table (or pixels in the image)
will be skipped and will not be passed to the work
function.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">nPerLoop - specifies the number of table rows (or number of
image pixels) that are to be passed to the work
function on each iteration. If nPerLoop = 0
then CFITSIO will calculate the optimum number
for greatest efficiency.
If nPerLoop is negative, then all the rows
or pixels will be passed at one time, and the work
function will only be called once. If any variable
		 length arrays are being processed, then the nPerLoop
		 value is ignored, and the iterator will always process
		 one row of the table at a time.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">*workFn - the name (actually the address) of the work function
that is to be called by fits_iterate_data.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">*userPointer - this is a user supplied pointer that can be used
to pass ancillary information from the driver routine
to the work function. It may point to a single number,
an array, or to a structure containing an arbitrary set
of parameters.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">*status - The CFITSIO error status. Should = 0 on input;
a non-zero output value indicates an error.
</LI></UL><P>When fits_iterate_data is called it first allocates memory to hold
all the requested columns of data or image pixel arrays. It then reads
the input data from the FITS tables or images into the arrays then
passes the structure with pointers to these data arrays to the work
function. After the work function returns, the iterator function
writes any output columns of data or images back to the FITS files. It
then repeats this process for any remaining sets of rows or image
pixels until it has processed the entire table or image or until the
work function returns a non-zero status value. The iterator then frees
the memory that it initially allocated and returns control to the
driver routine that called it.</P><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc34"></A><A NAME="htoc55">6.3</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Guidelines for Using the Iterator Function</H2><P>The totaln, offset, firstn, and nvalues parameters that are passed to
the work function are useful for determining how much of the data has
been processed and how much remains left to do. On the very first call
to the work function firstn will be equal to offset + 1; the work
function may need to perform various initialization tasks before
starting to process the data. Similarly, firstn + nvalues - 1 will be
equal to totaln on the last iteration, at which point the work function
may need to perform some clean up operations before exiting for the
last time. The work function can also force an early termination of
the iterations by returning a status value = -1.</P><P>The narrays and iteratorCol.datatype arguments allow the work function
to double check that the number of input arrays and their data types
have the expected values. The iteratorCol.fptr and iteratorCol.colnum
structure elements can be used if the work function needs to read or
write the values of other keywords in the FITS file associated with
the array. This should generally only be done during the
initialization step or during the clean up step after the last set of
data has been processed. Extra FITS file I/O during the main
processing loop of the work function can seriously degrade the speed of
the program.</P><P>If variable-length array columns are being processed, then the iterator
will operate on one row of the table at a time. In this case the
the repeat element in the interatorCol structure will be set equal to
the number of elements in the current row that is being processed.</P><P>One important feature of the iterator is that the first element in each
array that is passed to the work function gives the value that is used
to represent null or undefined values in the array. The real data then
begins with the second element of the array (i.e., array[1], not
array[0]). If the first array element is equal to zero, then this
indicates that all the array elements have defined values and there are
no undefined values. If array[0] is not equal to zero, then this
indicates that some of the data values are undefined and this value
(array[0]) is used to represent them. In the case of output arrays
(i.e., those arrays that will be written back to the FITS file by the
iterator function after the work function exits) the work function must
set the first array element to the desired null value if necessary,
otherwise the first element should be set to zero to indicate that
there are no null values in the output array. CFITSIO defines 2
values, FLOATNULLVALUE and DOUBLENULLVALUE, that can be used as default
null values for float and double data types, respectively. In the case
of character string data types, a null string is always used to
represent undefined strings.</P><P>In some applications it may be necessary to recursively call the iterator
function. An example of this is given by one of the example programs
that is distributed with CFITSIO: it first calls a work function that
writes out a 2D histogram image. That work function in turn calls
another work function that reads the &#X2018;X&#X2019; and &#X2018;Y&#X2019; columns in a table to
calculate the value of each 2D histogram image pixel. Graphically, the
program structure can be described as:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim"> driver --&gt; iterator --&gt; work1_fn --&gt; iterator --&gt; work2_fn
</PRE><P>Finally, it should be noted that the table columns or image arrays that
are passed to the work function do not all have to come from the same
FITS file and instead may come from any combination of sources as long
as they have the same length. The length of the first table column or
image array is used by the iterator if they do not all have the same
length.</P><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc35"></A><A NAME="htoc56">6.4</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Complete List of Iterator Routines</H2><P>All of the iterator routines are listed below. Most of these routines
