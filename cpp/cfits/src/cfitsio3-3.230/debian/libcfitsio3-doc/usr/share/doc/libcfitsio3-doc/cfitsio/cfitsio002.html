<H1 CLASS="chapter"><A NAME="htoc1">Chapter&#XA0;1</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Introduction </H1><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc1"></A><A NAME="htoc2">1.1</A>&#XA0;&#XA0; A Brief Overview</H2><P>CFITSIO is a machine-independent library of routines for reading and
writing data files in the FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) data
format. It can also read IRAF format image files and raw binary data
arrays by converting them on the fly into a virtual FITS format file.
This library is written in ANSI C and provides a powerful yet simple
interface for accessing FITS files which will run on most commonly used
computers and workstations. CFITSIO supports all the features
described in the official NOST definition of the FITS format and can
read and write all the currently defined types of extensions, including
ASCII tables (TABLE), Binary tables (BINTABLE) and IMAGE extensions.
The CFITSIO routines insulate the programmer from having to deal with
the complicated formatting details in the FITS file, however, it is
assumed that users have a general knowledge about the structure and
usage of FITS files.</P><P>CFITSIO also contains a set of Fortran callable wrapper routines which
allow Fortran programs to call the CFITSIO routines. See the companion
&#X201C;FITSIO User&#X2019;s Guide&#X201D; for the definition of the Fortran subroutine
calling sequences. These wrappers replace the older Fortran FITSIO
library which is no longer supported.</P><P>The CFITSIO package was initially developed by the HEASARC (High Energy
Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center) at the NASA Goddard Space
Flight Center to convert various existing and newly acquired
astronomical data sets into FITS format and to further analyze data
already in FITS format. New features continue to be added to CFITSIO
in large part due to contributions of ideas or actual code from
users of the package. The Integral Science Data Center in Switzerland,
and the XMM/ESTEC project in The Netherlands made especially significant
contributions that resulted in many of the new features that appeared
in v2.0 of CFITSIO.</P><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc2"></A><A NAME="htoc3">1.2</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Sources of FITS Software and Information</H2><P>The latest version of the CFITSIO source code,

</PRE><P>This User&#X2019;s Guide assumes that readers already have a general
understanding of the definition and structure of FITS format files.
Further information about FITS formats is available from the FITS Support
Office at <TT>http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov</TT>. In particular, the
&#X2019;NOST FITS Standard&#X2019; gives the authoritative definition of the FITS data
format, and the &#X2018;FITS User&#X2019;s Guide&#X2019; provides additional historical background
and practical advice on using FITS files.</P><P>The HEASARC also provides a very sophisticated FITS file analysis
program called &#X2018;Fv&#X2019; which can be used to display and edit the contents
of any FITS file as well as construct new FITS files from scratch. The
display functions in Fv allow users to interactively adjust the
brightness and contrast of images, pan, zoom, and blink images, and
measure the positions and brightnesses of objects within images. FITS
tables can be displayed like a spread sheet, and then modified using
powerful calculator and sorting functions. Fv is freely available for
most Unix platforms, Mac PCs, and Windows PCs.
CFITSIO users may also be interested in the FTOOLS package of programs
that can be used to manipulate and analyze FITS format files.
Fv and FTOOLS are available from their respective Web sites at:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">        http://fv.gsfc.nasa.gov

possible through collaborations with many people or organizations from
around the world. The following in particular have made especially
significant contributions:</P><P>Programmers from the Integral Science Data Center, Switzerland (namely,
Jurek Borkowski, Bruce O&#X2019;Neel, and Don Jennings), designed the concept
for the plug-in I/O drivers that was introduced with CFITSIO 2.0. The
use of &#X2018;drivers&#X2019; greatly simplified the low-level I/O, which in turn
made other new features in CFITSIO (e.g., support for compressed FITS
files and support for IRAF format image files) much easier to
implement. Jurek Borkowski wrote the Shared Memory driver, and Bruce
O&#X2019;Neel wrote the drivers for accessing FITS files over the network
using the FTP, HTTP, and ROOT protocols. Also, in 2009, Bruce O&#X2019;Neel
was the key developer of the thread-safe version of CFITSIO.</P><P>The ISDC also provided the template parsing routines (written by Jurek
Borkowski) and the hierarchical grouping routines (written by Don
Jennings). The ISDC DAL (Data Access Layer) routines are layered on
top of CFITSIO and make extensive use of these features.</P><P>Giuliano Taffoni and Andrea Barisani, at INAF, University of Trieste,
Italy, implemented the I/O driver routines for accessing FITS files
on the computational grids using the gridftp protocol.</P><P>Uwe Lammers (XMM/ESA/ESTEC, The Netherlands) designed the
high-performance lexical parsing algorithm that is used to do
on-the-fly filtering of FITS tables. This algorithm essentially
pre-compiles the user-supplied selection expression into a form that
can be rapidly evaluated for each row. Peter Wilson (RSTX, NASA/GSFC)
then wrote the parsing routines used by CFITSIO based on Lammers&#X2019;
design, combined with other techniques such as the CFITSIO iterator
routine to further enhance the data processing throughput. This effort
also benefited from a much earlier lexical parsing routine that was
developed by Kent Blackburn (NASA/GSFC). More recently, Craig Markwardt
(NASA/GSFC) implemented additional functions (median, average, stddev)
and other enhancements to the lexical parser.</P><P>The CFITSIO iterator function is loosely based on similar ideas
developed for the XMM Data Access Layer.</P><P>Peter Wilson (RSTX, NASA/GSFC) wrote the complete set of
Fortran-callable wrappers for all the CFITSIO routines, which in turn
rely on the CFORTRAN macro developed by Burkhard Burow.</P><P>The syntax used by CFITSIO for filtering or binning input FITS files is
based on ideas developed for the AXAF Science Center Data Model by
Jonathan McDowell, Antonella Fruscione, Aneta Siemiginowska and Bill
Joye. See http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/journal/axaf7.html for
further description of the AXAF Data Model.</P><P>The file decompression code were taken directly from the gzip (GNU zip)
program developed by Jean-loup Gailly and others.</P><P>The new compressed image data format (where the image is tiled and
the compressed byte stream from each tile is stored in a binary table)
was implemented in collaboration with Richard White (STScI), Perry
Greenfield (STScI) and Doug Tody (NOAO).</P><P>Doug Mink (SAO) provided the routines for converting IRAF format
images into FITS format.</P><P>Martin Reinecke (Max Planck Institute, Garching)) provided the modifications to
cfortran.h that are necessary to support 64-bit integer values when calling
C routines from fortran programs. The cfortran.h macros were originally developed
by Burkhard Burow (CERN).</P><P>In addition, many other people have made valuable contributions to the
development of CFITSIO. These include (with apologies to others that may
have inadvertently been omitted):</P><P>Steve Allen, Carl Akerlof, Keith Arnaud, Morten Krabbe Barfoed, Kent

compress_alternate.c and wcsutil_alternate.c) are provided for users

with &#X2018;compress_alternate.c&#X2019; and &#X2019;wcsutil.c&#X2019; with &#X2019;wcsutil_alternate.c
before compiling the CFITSIO library. This
will produce a version of CFITSIO which does not support reading or
writing compressed FITS files, or doing image coordinate transformations,
but is otherwise identical to the standard version.</P><HR>
