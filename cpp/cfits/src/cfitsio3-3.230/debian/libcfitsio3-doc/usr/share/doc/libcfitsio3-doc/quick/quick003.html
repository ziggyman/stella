<H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="htoc2">2</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Installing and Using CFITSIO</H2><P>First, you should download the CFITSIO software and the set of example
FITS utility programs from the web site at
http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio. The example programs illustrate
how to perform many common types of operations on FITS files using
CFITSIO. They are also useful when writing a new program because it is
often easier to take a copy of one of these utility programs as a
template and then modify it for your own purposes, rather than writing
the new program completely from scratch.</P><P>To build the CFITSIO library on Unix platforms, &#X2018;untar&#X2019; the source code
distribution file and then execute the following commands in the
directory containing the source code:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;  ./configure [--prefix=/target/installation/path]
&gt;  make           (or 'make shared')
&gt;  make install   (this step is optional)
</PRE><P>The optional
&#X2019;prefix&#X2019; argument to configure gives the path to the directory where
the CFITSIO library and include files should be installed via the later
&#X2019;make install&#X2019; command. For example,</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">&gt;  ./configure --prefix=/usr1/local
</PRE><P>will cause the &#X2019;make install&#X2019; command to copy the CFITSIO libcfitsio file 
to /usr1/local/lib and the necessary include files to /usr1/local/include
(assuming of course that the process has permission to write to these 
directories).</P><P>Pre-compiled versions of the CFITSIO DLL library are available for
PCs. On Macintosh machines, refer to the README.MacOS file for
instructions on building CFITSIO using CodeWarrior.</P><P>Any programs that use CFITSIO must of course be linked with the CFITSIO
library when creating the executable file. The exact procedure for
linking a program depends on your software environment, but on Unix
platforms, the command line to compile and link a program will look
something like this:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">gcc -o myprog myprog.c -L. -lcfitsio -lm -lnsl -lsocket
</PRE><P>You may not need to include all of the &#X2019;m&#X2019;, &#X2019;nsl&#X2019;, and &#X2019;socket&#X2019; system
libraries on your particular machine. To find out what libraries are
required on your (Unix) system, type <TT>&#X2019;make testprog&#X2019;</TT> and see what
libraries are then included on the resulting link line.</P><HR>
