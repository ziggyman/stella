2.1 Released 13 December 2012

* Add class mglDataC for complex data arrays.
* Add mglData::Solve() for finding x-value where dat(x)=val.
* Add mglData::Clean() for removing rows with duplicate values for given column.
* Add Vect3() plot for drawing vectors on slice of 3d vector field.

* Add WriteJSON() function for exporting in JSON format suitable for later drawing by JavaScript
* Add JavaScript code for visualizing JSON data.
* Add mgl.cgi tool which return PNG image for CGI request in form of MGL script.
* Add MGL commands 'errbox', 'face'

* Color can be specified as its RGB[A] values, i.e. like "{xFFFFFF}" or "{xFFFFFFFF}".
* Color in color scheme  may have position in range [0,1]. Format is {CN,pos} or {xFFFFFF,pos}.
* Now pen width for marks is proportional to pen width of line multiplied by size of marks.
* Now you can use different font-faces in the plot simultaneously.
* Now Legend() automatically use several columns if it contain too many legend entries.

* Grid lines for NAN origin values are always located at far-away edges.
* Try correctly place axis and tick labels even for axis with inverse range (i.e. for v2<v1).
  Note, it work well for 2D axis. One should use Aspect() with negative values to do it correctly in general case.

* Update documentation
* Different bugfixes
