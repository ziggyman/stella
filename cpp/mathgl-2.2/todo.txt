============= NEW FOR LATER =============

1. Export to COLLADA !!!
2. GTK window/widgets ???
3. Labels at TriCont()
4. Rewrite glyph drawing for bitmaps (speeding up by excluding boundary checks) ?!?

5. 2D textures as one of standard way for coloring -- if '%' present in color scheme
6. Graph(mreal x, mreal y, names, styles, font, size); -- names = "node1[node2,node3,node4[node5,node6]]", styles -- the same + apply for subnodes if absent. Styles are colors (fill,border,line), dash (to subnodes), marks "dos^v><", arrows.
7. 3D text (with depth, for Quality=3)
8. Text along 3D curve (for Quality=3)
9. introduce new primitive type=5 -- arrow for Quality&3!=3. for better drawing in projections + json/view ?!?

10. New tests:
	c. Tests for mglDataC arrays (as separate flag)
	e. Test for Crop, Momentum, NormSl, Sew, DiffParam, Envelope, STFA for all directions "xyz"; Clean, Last, First, Find, Spline3, FindAny, Insert, Delete, Put, SetId/Column, Squeeze, Extend, Trace, Combine, new Max/Min/Momentum, FillSample, Hist, operators, Sort, Roots, Jacobian
	u. Test FlowP + 3d

11. Check centered curved text (see text2)
14. Export to X3D


============= DOCUMENTATION =============

A. Paper about MathGL!!!
B. Add chapter with real samples
C. Translate to Russian everything

1. Extend Dots sample (add A, CA, Tens)
2. Extend Refill sample (add 2d)

============= UDAV =============

01. Show plot at creation stage (if option is enabled -- can be long process!!!) + auto axis range or [-1,1] by default

02. Double click -> setup dialog (optionally -- after QTreeWidgetItem)

03. Dialog for InPlot(s):
{SubPlot,MultiPlot}	-- enable rotate,aspect,title
{ColumnPlot}		-- enable rotate,several
{StickPlot}		-- enable several
{InPlot}			-- enable rotate,aspect,title
Image with gray alternatives and black choice

04. QTreeWidgetItem -- ICON (func/call,if,for,once,subplot,...); annotation/name; (keep LINE - POS in script). After editing/changing --> put text to editor.
Buttons: new,load,save // newcmd,hide,annotation,collapse on/off,setup // calc. Click on item cause change of line number in editor.
05. Group/ungroup if command in single line, separated by ':'
06. Hide plot/group by putting "#h " at beginning of line
07. Annotation of plot/group -- comment before it
08. Drag&drop plot/group between inplots (in tree widget)

09. Create default plot dependently of selected row/column/range in data table
10. Data change via menu/toolbar -- save to internal script => enable undo + save initial array(?)

11. Speed up rotation like as done in JavaScript

12. Multi-threading for enabling "stop".

13. Manual rotate (i.e. change rotate arguments) by spinboxes ???

14. Close button on data tabs ?!?

15. Add dialog for mask creation.

============= UNSURE ===========

1. Problem with \calB and so on (\calH, ...) -- they are present only in italic font :(.
2. create PWT fonts
3. \dfrac for normal size and centering  (sample \big\big{\frac{1}{2}}) ???
4. "Cut off" curves if text is printed inside it (for contour labels) ?!?
5. String variables in MGL + readstr command.
6. Pool of threads for speeding up ??? or openmp ???
7. Read DICOM files
8. Check RunThr() in python/octave
9. Try libtcc (TinyCC) as alternative to MGL -- how to handle ^ operator???
10. Auto axis range for formulas, like AutoRange("y(x)") or AutoRange('x',"x(t)").
11. Use Hershey as built-in font ??? -- for smaller size only
