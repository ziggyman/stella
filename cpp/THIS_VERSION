* added createmakefiles for the automatical creation of makefiles for all modules
  Usage: cd mcreatemakefiles/src
         make clean
         make ../bin/createmakefiles
         cp src/createmakefiles ../../
         cd ../../
         ./createmakefiles @dirs.list @modules.list <this directory, e.g. ~/stella/cpp/>
         ./make_all
* fixed bug which caused an offset of 0.5 pixels between calculated spatial profile 
  and spectral trace
* added spline fitting as alternative to Chi-square minimization for the calculation of 
  the spatial profile (CFits::SlitFunc)
