<A NAME="startup"></A><H1>Observing Startup Procedure</H1>


<a name="Object Catalogue"></a><h2>Object Catalogue</h2>

<p>
Well in advance of performing the observations an object catalogue can 
be made. Note that it is also possible to enter targets on-the-fly and
create a catalogue directly on the TCS while observing.
</p>
<p>
If you have submitted a catalogue by using our web interface <a 
href="/cgi-bin/source-catalog.pl">NOT Source Catalogue Creation</a>, you
can load this catalogue on the TCS by the keypad keystrokes: <b>Main, 
Catalogue, Load Catalogue</b> and then typing 
<i><b>/catalog/catname.cat</b></i>
</p>
<p>
There is an online catalogue on the TCS which contains blank fields for
twilight flats and focus stars. This one is loaded as above but 
typing only <i><b>blanks</b></i>. Instead of using the keypads you can 
type on the command line directly <b><i>lo blanks</i></b>.
</p>

<a name="Software Startup"></a><h2>Software Startup Procedure</h2>

To start up the instrument control software, see the Software
Startup Procedure for the relevant instrument:
<ul>
<li><a href="/instruments/alfosc/alfosc-start.html">ALFOSC</a></li> 
<li><a href="/instruments/stancam/stancam-start.html">StanCam</a></li>
<li><a href="/instruments/mosaic/mosca-start.html">MOSCA</a></li>
</ul>

or see the <a href="/instruments/notcam/guide/obs-step.html">NOTCam step-by-step guide</a>.

<a name="RPCaccess"></a><h2>RPC access code on TCS</h2>

Any instrument computer which needs access to the TCS, for instance to move 
the telescope during slit aquisition or dithering, will ask you about the
current <i>RPC access code</i> at start-up. See BIAS start-up. This code
is updated every day (around lunch time). When you are asked to supply the
RPC access code, do as follows on the TCS terminal:

<ul>
<li>Go to <b>Main Menu</b>.</li>
<li>Press numerical key <b><i><span class="nobreak">8 "Status
Pages"</span></i></b>.</li>
<li>Select numerical key <b><i><span class="nobreak">1 "Page
number"</span></i></b>.</li>
<li>Then type <b><i>84 </i></b>  with the alpha-numeric keys to view
page 84.</li>
<li>Read off the code as the first line on this page.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Bias Frames"></a><h2>Obtaining Bias Frames</h2>
<p>
See the <a href="/instruments/alfosc/alfosc-bias-commands.html">BIAS
command list</a> on how to obtain dark exposures of 0 seconds. For
nicer FITS headers, set the image type, the object and the observer.
</p>
<div class="print"></div>
<p>
     Acquire at least two bias frames in the beginning of the night and 
     again in the end of the night. With two bias frames and with two flat 
     fields of the same level, gain and readout noise can be determined, 
     e.g. by using the IRAF task <i>findgain</i>.
</p>

<A NAME="TCS"></A> <H2>Telescope Control System (TCS)</H2>

    <OL>
      <LI> Turn up the brightness of the TCS screen. 
           (on right-hand side, below the screen)
      <LI> Look at the top-left of the TCS screen. If item <B>ST</B> is 
           incrementing, then the TCS is running, if not - then the TCS needs 
           resetting (see the TCS Manual - in a binder in the control room)
           <!-- <A HREF="/telescope/tcs/tcsmanual.ps"> 
           TCS Manual Sect. 10.3</A>) -->. <br>
           Type <B><I>refresh</I></B> if the screen looks strange .
    </OL> 


<A name="telescope"></A><H2>Telescope power-on and Dome Opening</H2>


    <OL>
      <LI> Check safety system in the computer room (See  <A 
           HREF="/telescope/tcs/tcsmanual.ps"> TCS 
           Manual Sect. 10.1</A> for procedure) by pressing first the left
	   and then the right reset button by the red LED lamps and then 
	   turning the left and the right keys. If you get a repeated clunking
	   sound then the system has not reset, check the red lights above to
	   see if a safety stop or other item is set.

      <LI> Type <i><B>power-on</B></i> at TCS and confirm with <B>y</B> for
           <B>YES</B>. Wait for the message <B>Telescope Power is ON</B>
           before continuing. This takes about 1 minute.

      <LI> At sunset, if weather conditions are OK (see 
           wind/humidity/dust restrictions on the wall in the control room),
           open upper hatch with mirror covers closed.<br>
           Use keypad keystrokes: <B>Main, Start/Stop, Open
           Upper Hatch</B>. This takes about 3.5 minutes. 

      <LI>In dome (While upper hatch opens):

      <UL>

        <LI> open side ports (again, only if conditions are OK ). Do 
             not use too much force, but use the handle for lifting the ports 
             if needed <B>-you could damage the side ports!!</B>.
        <LI> check that nothing is in the way of telescope motion
             (6.5-90 degs altitude) 

      </UL>

      <LI> Open lower hatch  (again, only if weather
           conditions are OK. In case you can open the upper hatch but not the lower hatch then the maximum zenith distance for observing is 55 degrees ). Use keypad keystrokes: <B>Main, Start/Stop, Open
           Lower Hatch</B>. This takes about 2 minutes. <BR>Do not open lower 
           hatch before upper hatch has completed opening.  
      <LI> While lower hatch is opening, mirror covers can be opened as well. 
           Use keypad keystrokes: <B>Main, Start/Stop, Open
           Mirror Covers. </B>This takes about 50 sec. <br>

           Please note that power for hatches and mirror covers is completely 
           independent of the telescope power and electronics in Control room.
    </OL>


<A name="rotator"></A><H2>Field Rotator</H2>

At the TCS terminal give the rotator setup commands as indicated in the 
table below:<br><br>

<div class="print"></div>

<p>
Note that if you do spectroscopy only, setting the field will usually not 
be useful as you probably would like to observe on 
<a href="/instruments/alfosc/paralang.html"> the parallactic angle</A>, 
in which case the field will be different for each target. To observe in 
this mode, simply do: <BR>

<ol>  
<li><b><i>Define-Parallactic-Instrument-Angle XX</i></b> or just 
    <b><i>d-p XX</i></b> at the start of your run (sticky command). 
    <BR><BR>
    <center>
    <table border=1 BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF" cellpadding=6 CELLSPACING=0>
    <tr>
    <td align="center"><b><i>d-p 0</i></b> </td>
    <td align="center">ALFOSC</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td align="center"><b><i>d-p -90</i></b> </td>
    <td align="center"> SOFIN and NOTCam</td>
    </tr></table></center><BR>

<li>For presetting the telescope use <b>Catalogue</b> function 
    <b><i><span class="nobreak">7 "Preset w par ang"</span></i></b> instead 
    of the usual <b><i><span class="nobreak">4 "Preset to this"</span></i></b>.
</ol>

Upon every preset the rotator position will be close to the value defined
as above at start. Note that the rotator should be set to automatic mode 
(command <b><i>rot-auto</i></b> on the TCS) in order to keep a constant 
field orientation, such that it will gradually move away from zero. If you 
want to know your current field angle, for instance
to be able to compare an aquisition image with a finding chart, then type on
the TCS <i><b>field</b></i> and then press the HELP key.

<A name="Calibration frames"></A><H2>Calibration frames</H2>

The type of calibration frames needed depend very much on your science
goals and the instrument mode you are using. We recommend our documentation
on the different instrument pages. Please, check the User Guides available

           <A HREF="/instruments/mosaic/">MOSCA</A>,
           make flat fields in the desired filters.
           It is recommended to: <BR> 
           - rotate the field 90 degrees for each image. Use the commands
           <B><I>field 0, field 90,,</I></B> etc.<br>
           - make small offsets between the images, in order to be able
           to get rid of stars (on the TCS set offset size with the command
           <B><I>o-s 10 10</I></B> and then use arrow keys to make the actual
           offsets while the CCD is reading out). It is recommended to be 
           close to focus for each filter, and to use an offset size at least
           10 times the size of the FWHM of the seeing disk in order to 
           easily filter out the stars.

<A name="focusing"></A><H1>Focusing the telescope</H1>

The telescope focus depends on temperature and zenith distance. These 
relations have been measured to a high accuracy and the corresponding 
corrections are applied in real time by the TCS. (Note that you will 
not see these corrections in the focus value displayed on the TCS. To
avoid confusing the observer this one is kept constant.) The focus should 
therefore remain stable during not only a night but a complete run. We 
do, however, encourage observers to check the focus a couple of times 
during the night. Below we describe how to set and monitor the focus 
for our different instruments.

    <OL>

      <LI> Find a nearby field with focus stars in the <i>blanks</I> catalogue
           (<i><B> lo blanks</B></i>).

<h2>Using ALFOSC</h2>

<P>

When focusing ALFOSC we use the 'focus pyramid', an optical device which 
splits the light beam into four segments, each of them producing an image 
of the star on the CCD. The distance between the four images is linearly 
dependent on the focus of the telescope. By measuring the distance between 
the four images of a star we directly get the correct focus of the telescope 
- independently of seeing variations.

<P>

Follow the <a href="/instruments/alfosc/focus.html"> ALFOSC focus 
procedure</a>. 

<p>

<table align="right" border=1 BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF" cellpadding=6 CELLSPACING=0>

<p>

The focus offsets (with respect to "no filter") for the 
standard UBVRi broadband filters used in the ALFOSC filter wheel are 
listed in the table to the right. For more filters, check the determined <a 
href="/instruments/filters/focusoffset.html">filter focus offsets</a>.

<P>

<!--  or use the script 'pfocus' 
by issuing the command 'run pfocus' to obtain an exposure (this sets suitable
windowing of the CCD, exposure time etc). When you have the image on the
screen, go into 'imexamine' mode, point to the top image in the quartet
and press 'f'. This directly gives you the focus offset you should
apply to the telescope. You can now set the correct telescope focus for this
filter in two ways. 1) Either use the command 'focus-delta nnn' in the TCS,
where 'nnn' is the desired focus offset (provided that 'focus-delta' was set
to zero when you took the exposure). 2) Or add the focus offset to the current 'focus-position' value. Note that 'nnn' may be positive or negative. -->

<P>

When you have corrected the focus, it is appropriate to check it 3 times.
The focus value you have found for "no filter" in the beam is the right
focus to use for ALFOSC spectroscopic mode.

<p>

Note that the internal ALFOSC focus has default value 1877 and is found to
be very stable. No need to change it (unless you use the spectro-polarimetry 
mode).<br><br>

<p>

For <a href="/instruments/alfosc/polarimetry/index.html">ALFOSC polarimetry
</A> the recommended focusing procedure is a bit different from above (see
<A HREF="/instruments/alfosc/polarimetry/focusfapol.html">About focusing
FAPOL</A>).
For spectro-polarimetry the internal ALFOSC focus must be changed (to 900)
in order to have the polarimetric slitlet in focus. Compared to normal ALFOSC 
use a substantial focus offset is required by putting in the retarder plate 
(either the half-wave or the quarter-wave, which have different thickness 
and therefore different focus shifts) and the calcite plates in the focal 
plane (aperture wheel). 


<!--Run the 'pfocus' script and estimate the focus 3 times (should take less
than 2 minutes). Take the average of these measurements and apply it. 
The error of the measurement depends strongly on the conditions that 
specific night. Notably local seeing introduces a lot of noise in the 
measurement.-->

<P>
<div class="print"></div>

<h2>Using StanCam</h2>

A traditional focus sequence should be made exposing at different focus 
values and stepping the telescope such that a number of focus measurements 
can be read out on the same image. This is done in StanCam BIAS with the 
command: <BR><BR>

<b><i>focus [focus startvalue] [focus stepsize] [ttt]</i></b> <BR><BR>

where you should enter a focus startvalue close to the default focus
for StanCam (23080), a focus stepsize of around 50 during the first
iteration, and an exposure time preferrably as long as 15 seconds to filter
out possible rapid seeing variations.

<p>

When the command is finished and the image is read out you will find your
focus star stepped along the CCD, the last measurement being offset 90
degrees with respect to the others. Estimate the sharpness and roundness
of the exposures with <i><b>imexam</b></i> and possibly iterate with a
smaller focus stepsize around the best value.

<h2>Using MOSCA</h2>

The same procedure as for StanCam, but default focus for 
<A HREF="http://geena.not.iac.es/instruments/mosaic/">MOSCA</A> is
23250. 


<h2>Using NOTCam</h2>

Default telescope focus for 
<A HREF="/instruments/notcam/">NOTCam</A> is 23500 for the K bands in 
imaging mode with the WF camera (when the internal camera focus is set 
to 6000). Check the <A HREF="/instruments/notcam/guide/observe.html#focusing">
NOTCam User's Guide</A> under section <b>Focusing</b> for instructions
regarding imaging mode focusing.

<A name="autoguiding"></A><H1>Autoguiding</H1>

It is advantageous to have the telescope `autoguide' on an optical 
source close to your target object. By autoguiding we 
mean let the telescope control software (TCS) monitor the position of 
a reference star and correct the 'pointing' of the telescope quickly 
to correct for drifts in tracking. Autoguiding will produce the best 
image quality - especially away from zenith. <P> 

At the NOT we have implemented a system whereby whenever the telescope 
is positioned preset to an object, the TCS <I>automatically</I> selects 
a suitable star from the HST guide star catalogue. The guide probe is 
then automatically placed at the correct position to auto-guide on this 
star. This saves considerable (and valuable) observing time over manual 
searches for guide stars. When the telescope instrument rotator (field 
angle) is manually changed (e.g. for slit rotation) the TCS will 
automatically re-select a guide star for the new field angle. This
means that retyping your current field angle on the TCS is a way to
research for a guide star at current position (if you somehow lost it).

<div class="print"></div>
<P>

Once a guide star has been selected the observer simply starts the
autoguider. The TCS always selects the best (brightest) guide star
available at the current position and displays it on the Guide Monitor. 
To start autoguiding do the following:

<OL>
<LI> If the guide star looks very faint or you can't see it, check that 
     TV filter is open or type on the TCS <i><b>tv-fil o</b></i>. 
<LI> If still too faint then start TV integration with the command 
     <i><B>int-fr n</B></i> where <i><B>n</B></I> is number of frames to 
     integrate, say 2 - 5. A small window pops up with the integrated 
     image. Place the Autoguider mouse pointer on the star and click the 
     right button labelled <B>INT</B>. Follow the steps below as for normal 
     autoguiding, but grab the star in that small window. To stop 
     integration mode, type <i><B>int-fr 0</B></i>. Note that the guide
     star should not be on the right edge of the screen because the 
     <b>INT</b> box will not reach there.       
<LI> Place the pointer accurately on the star by moving the Autoguider
     mouse.
<LI> Click the middle button labelled <B>STAR</B> to put the box onto
     the star.
<LI> Enter the command <i><B>a-g</B></i> to start autoguiding without
     relaxation, or <i><B>rel-a</B></i> to start autoguiding with 
     relaxation (the box is then moved to the star <B>without</B>
     moving the telescope).
<LI> On the TCS monitor the signal strength from the autoguider is shown
     as a number. Anything between 1 and 100 is useful. If your signal is
     above 100 then put in a filter (red, yellow, or grey) 
     <i><b>tv-fil r</b></i>, <i><b>tv-fil y</b></i>,
     or <i><b>tv-fil g</b></i>. If your signal is < 1 then guiding will
     be lost and you should use integration mode.
<LI> To stop autoguiding again, use  the command <B><i>a-s</i></B>
</OL>
     
Note: make sure the small box is outside the star box -if needed,
move it by clicking the button <B>SKY</B> (can be moved only while
not autoguiding).
This is the sky measurement box. You can change the star box size 
depending on the seeing by typing <b><i>b-s xx</i></b>, where xx is 
a number usually around 18-20.

<p>

<B>If you see no guide star</B>, then:
    <OL>
      <LI>Check that TV filter is open (<i><b>tv-fil o</b></i>).
      <LI>Check guide camera focus (set it by the command 
          <i><b>tv-foc xxx</b></i>).
      <LI>Check the VT100 terminal to your upper left which displays
          the magnitude of the latest acquired guide star. Depending 
          on the seeing and possible clouds it could be that the best 
          guide star in this field is too faint. If so, consider 
          whether you could use another field angle.
<!--  <LI>The last option is to search manually for guidestars with the
          commands <i>x </i> and  <i>y </i>. Check maps below Guide TV 
          to see that the probe is outside the vignetting field. --> 
    </OL>
<P>

<B>If you lose the guide star after a telescope offset</B>, then: <BR><BR>

       Give TCS command <b><i>field xx.x</i></b>, where xx.x is the current
       field angle. This leads to no movement of the telescope, but a 
       guidestar is re-acquired.

<A NAME="movingtargets"></A><H1>Tracking of moving targets </H1>

The NOT was not originally built for tracking of moving targets (planets, 
comets, asteroids, satellites), but there are currently two ways of doing 
this, depending on the speed of the object.

<P>

<H2> Slowly moving targets </H2>

For objects moving rather slowly, i.e. less than about 1 arcmin during an
exposure, the tracking is handled by moving the guide box on the autoguider 
screen, while autoguiding, in order to compensate for the object motion.

<P>

<OL>
<LI> Calculate your object's motion in RA and DEC rates in advance. 
     NB! Rates are in arcseconds per hour! 
<BR><BR>
<LI> Preset to your object, and get a guide star (hopefully) on the guide 
     monitor.
<BR><BR>
<div class="print"></div>
<LI> Position the box in an appropriate place on the screen. Then move the 
     <i>guide probe</i> to put the guide star in the box: first set the step 
     size by <b>p-s-s &lt;1000&gt; &lt;1000&gt;</b>, then go to MAIN MENU - 
     GUIDE PROBE - 
     OTHERS, and use the X+,Y+,X-,Y- keys to move the probe. When the star 
     is in the box,  start autoguiding with the TCS command <b>a-g</b>. 
<BR><BR>
<LI> Start then tracking of the moving object by the TCS command 
     <b>Box-Motion-Start &lt;RA-rate&gt; &lt;DEC-rate&gt;</b> or in short
     <b>ag-bo-on &lt;RA-rate&gt; &lt;DEC-rate&gt;</b>. If the box reaches 
     the opposite edge of 
     the monitor, it stops moving. You can try with a short box move with
     much higher rate, to find out in which direction the box moves.
<BR><BR>
<LI> Take the exposure, and then stop tracking by <b>Box-Motion-Stop</b>
       or in short <b>ag-bo-of</b>.
</OL>

<H2> Rapidly moving targets </H2>

<P>

For more rapidly moving targets, use the <b>set-rate</b> command to 
continuously move the telescope from a pre-calculated change in position. 
In this mode autoguiding is <I>not</I> used!
<P>
<OL>
<LI> Preset to your object.
<BR><BR>
<LI> Set the rate of change by <b>set-rate &lt;RA-rate&gt; &lt;DEC-rate&gt; 
     </b> (NB! Rate in arcsec per second!). The maximum rate is 1200 arcsec/s.
<BR><BR>
<LI> Make the exposure.
<BR><BR>
<LI> Reset by <b>set-rate 0 0 </b>.
</OL>


<H2>For experts only</H2>

If the target has an unknown or rapidly changing motion, you might want to 
adjust the rate of change in RA and DEC while tracking. Then, use the 
telescope in <b>set-mode</b>, as opposed to the default <b>offset-mode</b>. 
In <b>set-mode</b> the cursor keys (which in offset-mode are used to move 
the telescope with a given offset step), are now used to <i>adjust the rate 
of change</i> in RA and DEC, once set with <b>set-rate</b>. As in the above
case, autoguiding is <I>not</I> used.

<P>
The step of the 
adjustment is set with the command <b>set-step</b>, which can take values 
from 0.0009 to 1200.0 arc seconds per second (NB! Note the units!). 
The Up/Down keys adjusts the DEC set rate with +/- the set-step size,
and the Left/Right keys adjust RA set rate with -/+ the set-step size.
<P>

<OL>
<LI> Preset to your object.
<BR><BR>
<LI> Type in the TCS command <b> set-mode </b>
<BR><BR>
<LI> Guess the starting <b>set-rate &lt;RA rate&gt; &lt;DEC rate&gt; </b> 
     values.
<BR><BR>
<LI> Set the size of adjustment by <b>set-step &lt;size&gt; </b> and use 
     the cursor keys to adjust the speed.
<BR><BR>
<LI> Go back to <b>offset-mode</b> when finished tracking this object,
or before presetting to another object.
<BR><BR>
</OL>

NB! This mode is quite tricky to use correctly, and needs some practicing.

<P>
