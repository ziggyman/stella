Version 3.2
Move the stella directory to your home path.
edit loginuser.cl:
  set scripts to ~/stella/ and imdir to <image_directory>
mv <iraf-dir>/loginuser.cl <iraf-dir>/loginuser.cl.bak
ln -s ~/stella/loginuser.cl <iraf-dir>/loginuser.cl
add ~/stella/bin to your $PATH variable:
in ~/.bashrc add the following line to the end of the file:
export PATH=~/stella/bin:$PATH

Please note that most parameter files are not up to date and some parameters might be missing. 
However, each IRAF task will tell you if a parameter could not be found in the parameter file.
The master task is stall.cl, which encapsulates all tasks needed to reduce a standard spectrum.
Note that the STELLA pipeline was developed for spectra going up/down, not left/right. You can 
use the C++ programs imrotate or imtranspose to rotate/transpose spectra if needed.
Please also note that, before using the IRAF programs, you must create the reference files 
manually.

To install the external libraries like cfitsio, blitz++, gsl, and mathgl, and compile the C++ 
files please refere to the README file in the cpp directory.
